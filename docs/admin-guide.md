## 1. Hosting requirements

| Component             | Minimum                                       | Recommended          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Node.js               | 22 LTS                                        | 22 LTS               |
| Postgres              | 16                                            | 16                   |
| Object storage        | MinIO (self-hosted) or AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2 | MinIO on same subnet |
| RAM (server)          | 512 MB                                        | 2 GB                 |
| Disk (Postgres data)  | 10 GB                                         | 50 GB                |
| Disk (object storage) | 100 GB                                        | 1 TB                 |

The server runs as a single Node.js process. It serves both the API and the frontend
SPA (the frontend is pre-built and served as static files from `packages/analyzer/dist/`).

---

## 2. Deployment — server

### 2.1 Build

```bash
git clone <repo> provenance
cd provenance
npm install
npm run build
```

This produces:

- `packages/server/dist/index.js` — the server entry point
- `packages/analyzer/dist/` — the SPA static files

### 2.2 Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values:

```bash
cp packages/server/.env.example packages/server/.env
```

At minimum, set:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/provenance
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>
AUTH_COOKIE_SIGNING_SECRET=<random-32-bytes-base64>
OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
OBJECT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET=provenance
AUTH_SUPERADMIN_EMAILS=you@berkeley.edu
```

Generate the cookie secret:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 2.3 Run database migrations

```bash
node packages/server/dist/index.js --mode=migrate
```

Or use `npm run db:migrate --workspace=packages/server` (requires dev deps installed).

### 2.4 Start the server

**API only (recommended for separate worker deployment):**

```bash
node packages/server/dist/index.js --mode=api
```

**Worker only (runs cron jobs + background job processors):**

```bash
node packages/server/dist/index.js --mode=worker
```

**All-in-one (development / single-machine):**

```bash
node packages/server/dist/index.js --mode=all
```

The default `PORT` is 3000. Override with `PORT=8080`.

### 2.5 Serve the frontend

The SPA (`packages/analyzer/dist/`) can be served by any static file host:

- **Nginx:** configure `try_files $uri /index.html` for client-side routing.
- **Same server:** the Hono server can serve static files if you configure
  `STATIC_DIR=<path-to-dist>` (not yet wired in v3.0 — use a CDN or Nginx).
- **Vite preview** (dev only): `npm run preview --workspace=packages/analyzer`

Point the frontend's `VITE_API_BASE_URL` build-time variable at your API origin:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://provenance.example.edu/api/v1 npm run build --workspace=packages/analyzer
```

### 2.6 Scaling the ingest worker

Per-bundle ingest cost is ~1s of CPU and is at its algorithmic floor (see
`docs/ingest-complexity.md`), so the lever for large imports — a whole
semester of bundles at once — is **throughput**, not per-bundle speed. Three
settings govern it, and they must move together:

- **`INGEST_CONCURRENCY`** (default `4`) — how many `ingest_file` jobs one
  worker process drains at once. Set it roughly to the worker's core count;
  each concurrent job is ~1s of CPU, so it scales near-linearly with cores. A
  700-bundle drain measured **348s at concurrency 1 → 87s at 4 → 44s at 8**.
- **`DATABASE_POOL_MAX`** (default `10`) — per-process Postgres connection cap.
  Each in-flight ingest job holds ~1 connection for its transaction, and
  pg-boss needs its own connections to poll and complete jobs. **Keep
  `INGEST_CONCURRENCY` comfortably below `DATABASE_POOL_MAX`** (e.g. 8 with 16),
  or jobs starve waiting on connections. Confirm Postgres `max_connections`
  covers the pool across every server/worker process you run.
- **Cores and RAM** are the hardware ceilings. CPU saturates around
  **concurrency 6–8 on a single Postgres instance** (large-bundle throughput is
  DB-write-bound, so returns diminish once Postgres saturates on writes). RAM is
  the other bound: each concurrent job holds a full decompressed bundle working
  set in heap, so safe concurrency is roughly
  `min(cores, DATABASE_POOL_MAX − headroom, RAM ÷ peak-bundle-footprint)`.

For more throughput beyond one instance, run multiple `--mode=worker`
processes (§3.2 of the v3 PRD) against the same database; pg-boss distributes
jobs across them. Each process gets its own `DATABASE_POOL_MAX`, so size
Postgres `max_connections` for the total.

Example large-import worker config:

```bash
INGEST_CONCURRENCY=8 DATABASE_POOL_MAX=16 \
  node packages/server/dist/index.js --mode=worker
```

## 3. Google OAuth setup

Provenance uses Google OAuth with an `hd` (hosted domain) constraint. Only users
whose Google account belongs to your institution's Google Workspace domain can log in.

### 3.1 Create a project in Google Cloud Console

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. Create a new project: `provenance-<semester>`.
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
4. Click **Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**.
5. Application type: **Web application**.
6. Name: `Provenance Analyzer`.
7. **Javascript authorized origins:** add:
   ```
   https://provenance.example.edu
   ```
   (Replace with your actual domain. For local dev: `http://localhost` and `http://localhost:5173`)
8. **Authorized redirect URIs:** add:
   ```
   https://provenance.example.edu/api/v1/auth/google/callback
   ```
   (Replace with your actual domain. For local dev: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/google/callback`.)
9. Click **Create**. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### 3.2 Configure hosted domain restriction

Set `AUTH_ALLOWED_HOSTED_DOMAINS` to your institution's Google Workspace domain.
The default is `berkeley.edu`:

```
AUTH_ALLOWED_HOSTED_DOMAINS=berkeley.edu
```

To allow multiple domains (e.g. for cross-listed courses):

```
AUTH_ALLOWED_HOSTED_DOMAINS=berkeley.edu,stanford.edu
```

The server validates the `hd` claim in the Google ID token. Accounts that do not
match the allowed domains are rejected with a `HOSTED_DOMAIN_MISMATCH` error.

### 3.3 OAuth consent screen

In Google Cloud Console → **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**:

- User type: **Internal** (restricts to your Workspace domain automatically; recommended).
- App name: `Provenance`.
- Authorized domain: your institution domain.
- No additional scopes needed beyond `openid email profile`.

---

## 4. Bootstrap — first login and superadmin

### 4.1 Set AUTH_SUPERADMIN_EMAILS

Before any user logs in, set the `AUTH_SUPERADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable to
the email addresses that should receive superadmin privileges on first login:

```
AUTH_SUPERADMIN_EMAILS=alice@berkeley.edu,bob@berkeley.edu
```

On first login, the server checks whether the authenticated user's email is in this
list and sets `users.is_superadmin = true` if so.

**Production requirement:** `AUTH_SUPERADMIN_EMAILS` must be non-empty when
`NODE_ENV=production`. The server will refuse to start if it is empty.

### 4.2 Log in

Navigate to `https://provenance.example.edu` and click **Sign in with Google**.
After authenticating, you will land on the Home view. Your account will have
superadmin status if your email was in `AUTH_SUPERADMIN_EMAILS`.

### 4.3 Verify superadmin status

```bash
curl -s -H 'Cookie: __Host-prov_sess=<your-session-cookie>' \
  https://provenance.example.edu/api/v1/me \
  | python3 -m json.tool | grep is_superadmin
```

Expected: `"is_superadmin": true`.

## 5. Creating courses and semesters

Via the API (or, in a future release, via the UI):

```bash
# Create a course
curl -s -X POST https://provenance.example.edu/api/v1/courses \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Cookie: __Host-prov_sess=<session>' \
  -d '{"name": "CS 61A", "slug": "cs61a"}'

# Create a semester
curl -s -X POST https://provenance.example.edu/api/v1/courses/<courseId>/semesters \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Cookie: __Host-prov_sess=<session>' \
  -d '{
    "term": "fa",
    "year": 2025,
    "slug": "fa25",
    "display_name": "Fall 2025",
    "filename_convention": "^(?P<sid>\\d{8})-(?P<assignment_id>hw\\d+)\\.zip$",
    "blob_retention_days": 540
  }'
```

Invite staff members to the semester via `POST /semesters/<semesterId>/members/invite`.

### 5.1 Ingesting submissions

Once a semester exists, staff ingest a Gradescope "Download Submissions" export. The roster
is upserted from the export's `submission_metadata.yml` (no separate roster upload needed),
and every student bundle is processed through the pipeline (match → parse → heuristics →
cross-flags) by the worker. Both ingest paths produce identical results:

- **HTTP upload** — the analyzer's Ingest page, or `POST /semesters/<id>/ingest:gradescope`.
  The upload is streamed to disk (not buffered in memory), bounded by
  `INGEST_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` (default 10 GiB). The analyzer uploads large exports (≥ 1 GiB)
  **resumably** so an interrupted transfer continues instead of restarting.

- **Local-path ingest** — for very large exports (multi-GB / 10 GB+) staged on the server's
  disk, ingest directly from the filesystem with no upload and no in-memory size limit:

  ```bash
  npm run ingest:local --workspace=packages/server -- \
    --path /srv/exports/export.zip --semester <semester-id> --user staff@school.edu
  ```

  It reads the archive with a streaming random-access reader, so peak memory is a single
  submission bundle regardless of total size. A **worker must be running** to process the
  queued submissions. Full details, including arguments and behavior, are in
  [`packages/server/README.md` → Ingesting submissions](../packages/server/README.md#ingesting-submissions).

Whichever path is used, monitor progress via `GET /semesters/<id>/ingest/jobs/<jobId>` or
the analyzer's Ingest job view; unmatched submissions land in the unmatched tray for manual
resolution.

---

## 6. Retention policy

> **Storage model.** Two deliberate cost decisions shape what is stored:
>
> - **Events are not stored in Postgres.** All analysis runs at ingest; only the
>   derived results (`flags`, `per_file_stats`, `validation_results`, `cross_flags`)
>   are persisted. Replay, recompute, cross-flags, the events/timeline API and the
>   Source tab re-parse the stored bundle blob on demand.
> - **Stored bundles are provenance-only.** Ingest strips the student's source
>   files before storing; the blob keeps only the signed manifest + `.slog` logs.
>   It remains fully signature- and hash-chain-verifiable. Consequently, downloading
>   a submission bundle (`include_blobs`) yields no student source — a privacy win.
>   Until the bundle is swept, its event stream is fully recoverable from the logs.

### 6.1 How blob_retention_days works

Each semester has a `blob_retention_days` column (default: **540 days**, minimum: 30).
This controls how long the (provenance-only) submission bundle blobs are kept in
object storage after the semester is archived.

The lifecycle:

1. Semester is archived: `PATCH /semesters/<id>` with `{"archived_at": "<date>"}`.
2. A daily cron job (the **retention sweep**, runs at 2:00 UTC) checks all semesters.
3. For each archived semester where `now() >= archived_at + blob_retention_days`,
   the sweep deletes the blob from object storage. Once the blob is gone the event
   stream can no longer be re-parsed (replay/recompute become unavailable), but all
   derived rows remain.
4. **DB rows are never deleted.** The `submissions`, `flags`, `per_file_stats`,
   `validation_results`, and `cross_flags` rows persist indefinitely for audit.

### 6.2 Configuring retention

To set a custom retention window when creating a semester:

```bash
# 365-day retention (delete blobs 1 year after archiving)
"blob_retention_days": 365
```

To update an existing semester's retention:

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH https://provenance.example.edu/api/v1/semesters/<semesterId> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Cookie: __Host-prov_sess=<session>' \
  -d '{"blob_retention_days": 730}'
```

### 6.3 Archiving a semester

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH https://provenance.example.edu/api/v1/semesters/<semesterId> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Cookie: __Host-prov_sess=<session>' \
  -d '{"archived_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"}'
```

Once a semester is archived:

- No new ingests are accepted.
- The retention clock starts.
- Historical data (events, flags, scores) remains accessible.

Archiving a **course** (`POST /courses/<courseId>/archive`) cascades: every
not-yet-archived semester in the course is archived too (each starts its own
retention clock). Semesters already archived keep their original `archived_at`.
Archiving is forward-only — there is no unarchive; revert via point-in-time
recovery.

---

## 7. Cron jobs

Cron jobs are managed by pg-boss and run automatically when the worker process is
running. They are registered on every worker startup (idempotent).

| Job name                 | Schedule (UTC) | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `retention_sweep`        | 2:00 daily     | Delete blobs past retention window (PRD §16)      |
| `purge_expired_sessions` | Every hour     | Delete `sessions` rows where `expires_at < now()` |
| `purge_expired_exports`  | 3:00 daily     | Stub — will purge export artifacts in v3.1        |

To verify cron jobs are registered:

```sql
SELECT name, cron, created_on, updated_on
FROM pgboss.schedule
ORDER BY name;
```

Expected output shows all three job names with their cron expressions.

To manually trigger a cron job (e.g. for testing):

```sql
INSERT INTO pgboss.job (name, data) VALUES ('retention_sweep', '{}');
```

---

## 8. Backups

### 8.1 Postgres

Use `pg_dump` for logical backups. Schedule daily with cron:

```bash
# Daily backup at 1:00 UTC (before retention sweep at 2:00)
pg_dump --format=custom --compress=9 \
  --dbname="$DATABASE_URL" \
  --file="/backups/provenance-$(date +%Y%m%d).dump"

# Keep 30 days of backups
find /backups -name 'provenance-*.dump' -mtime +30 -delete
```

Restore from backup:

```bash
pg_restore --clean --if-exists --dbname="$DATABASE_URL" /backups/provenance-20251231.dump
```

### 8.2 Object storage (MinIO)

**Option A — MinIO replication (recommended for production):**

Configure MinIO bucket replication to a second site or S3 bucket:

```bash
mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 $ACCESS_KEY $SECRET_KEY
mc alias set backup https://s3.amazonaws.com $AWS_ACCESS_KEY $AWS_SECRET_KEY

mc replicate add local/provenance \
  --remote-bucket backup/provenance-backup \
  --priority 1
```

**Option B — nightly snapshot:**

```bash
mc mirror local/provenance /backups/minio-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

---

## 9. Restore drill

Run this procedure at least once before going to production to verify your backups
are restorable. Schedule quarterly thereafter.

### Step 1: Prepare a clean environment

Start fresh Postgres and MinIO instances (do not touch production):

```bash
docker run -d --name pg-restore \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test -e POSTGRES_DB=provenance \
  -p 5433:5432 postgres:16-alpine

docker run -d --name minio-restore \
  -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=testadmin -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=testadmin \
  -p 9100:9000 minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z server /data
```

### Step 2: Restore Postgres

```bash
pg_restore \
  --clean --if-exists \
  --dbname="postgres://test:test@localhost:5433/provenance" \
  /backups/provenance-<date>.dump
```

Verify row counts:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM submissions;   -- expect > 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;         -- expect > 0
SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM submissions;  -- expect recent date
```

### Step 3: Restore MinIO blobs

```bash
mc alias set restore http://localhost:9100 testadmin testadmin
mc mb restore/provenance
mc mirror /backups/minio-<date>/ restore/provenance/
```

Spot-check a blob:

```bash
mc ls restore/provenance/ | head -5
mc stat restore/provenance/<first-key>
```

### Step 4: Start the server against the restore environment

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://test:test@localhost:5433/provenance \
OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9100 \
node packages/server/dist/index.js --mode=api
```

### Step 5: Verify API responses

```bash
curl localhost:3000/healthz
curl -H 'Cookie: __Host-prov_sess=<test-session>' localhost:3000/api/v1/me
```

Confirm you can see users, semesters, and submissions.

### Step 6: Tear down

```bash
docker stop pg-restore minio-restore && docker rm pg-restore minio-restore
```

Document the time taken and any issues found. Update this runbook if needed.

## 11. Troubleshooting

### "HOSTED_DOMAIN_MISMATCH" on login

The user's Google account domain does not match `AUTH_ALLOWED_HOSTED_DOMAINS`.
Verify the env var is set correctly and the user is using their institutional
account (not a personal Gmail).

### Worker not processing jobs

1. Confirm the worker is running: `node dist/index.js --mode=worker` (or `--mode=all`).
2. Check pg-boss queue tables: `SELECT * FROM pgboss.job WHERE state = 'failed' ORDER BY created_on DESC LIMIT 20;`
3. Check server logs for `pg-boss error` entries.
4. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is the same for both API and worker processes.

### Retention sweep not running

Check the pg-boss schedule:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgboss.schedule WHERE name = 'retention_sweep';
```

If missing, restart the worker — `boss.schedule()` is called on startup and is
idempotent. Verify the worker started without errors after the `schedule()` calls.

### MinIO connection refused

Confirm MinIO is running and accessible from the server host:

```bash
curl -f http://<OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT>/minio/health/live
```

### Postgres migration errors

If `db:migrate` fails with "relation already exists", the migration was partially
applied. Connect to the database and check `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM drizzle.__drizzle_migrations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

For a clean dev environment, drop and recreate:

```bash
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d
npm run db:migrate --workspace=packages/server
```

**Never do this in production.** In production, diagnose the failed migration and
apply the missing DDL manually.
