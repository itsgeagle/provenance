/**
 * Local-path ingest: ingest a Gradescope export ZIP that already lives on the
 * server's own disk, reading it via a random-access streaming reader so a
 * multi-GB (10 GB+) export is processed with bounded memory.
 *
 * This is the disk-side counterpart to the HTTP `:gradescope` route. The route
 * buffers the whole upload in memory (and trips a ~2 GiB FormData ceiling);
 * this path never holds more than one rebuilt bundle at a time. It otherwise
 * reuses the exact same downstream pipeline — roster upsert → stage blob →
 * `ingest_files` row → enqueue one `ingest_file` job per submitter — so the
 * worker processes locally-ingested submissions identically to uploaded ones.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT enforce INGEST_MAX_BATCH_BYTES (the total-size cap that
 * exists to bound the in-memory HTTP path); processing arbitrarily large local
 * exports is the entire point. The per-bundle cap (INGEST_MAX_BUNDLE_BYTES) and
 * the file-count cap (INGEST_MAX_BATCH_FILES) still apply.
