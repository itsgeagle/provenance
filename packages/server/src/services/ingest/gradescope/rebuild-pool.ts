/**
 * A small `worker_threads` pool that offloads the expensive half of bundle
 * rebuilding — the JSZip serialization (`zipBundleEntries`) — off the ingest
 * staging main thread and across CPU cores.
 *
 * Why this exists: staging a large Gradescope export is single-threaded and its
 * per-bundle cost is dominated (~80%) by the pure-JS JSZip STORE serialization
 * running on the one staging worker's event loop, so throughput was capped at
 * one core no matter how many worker replicas or how much I/O concurrency we
 * added. The cheap selection (`selectBundleEntries`) stays on the producer; only
 * the CPU-heavy zip is farmed out here, so N bundles serialize in parallel.
 *
 * The worker is an **eval string**, not a separate module file, on purpose: the
 * server runs under `tsx` in dev and is bundled by esbuild into a single
 * `dist/index.js` in prod — a sibling worker file survives neither cleanly. The
 * string has no project-local or TypeScript imports; it dynamic-imports `jszip`
 * (an external dependency present in both dev and prod) and runs the identical
 * `new JSZip(); file(...); generateAsync({type:'arraybuffer'})` steps as
 * `zipBundleEntries`, so its output is byte-identical — the archive sha256 (the
 * Gradescope dedup key) is unchanged. `rebuild-pool.test.ts` pins that equality.
 *
 * Lifecycle: `createRebuildPool(size)` spawns `size` workers immediately;
 * `dispose()` terminates them all and rejects anything still queued. Callers
 * MUST `dispose()` (staging does so in a `finally`) — there is no implicit
 * shutdown.
