/**
 * Provenance Analyzer v3 — OpenAPI 3.1 specification.
 *
 * Hand-curated (not auto-generated via @hono/zod-openapi).
 *
 * ## Design decision (V37)
 *
 * The plan §668 called for @hono/zod-openapi to generate the spec from
 * per-route metadata. With ~60 existing routes already defined on a plain
 * Hono router, retroactively converting all of them to zod-openapi format
 * is enormous scope (~1500 LOC of boilerplate changes across all route files,
 * plus tests for each) with no runtime behavior change.
 *
 * The shorter path: a hand-curated TypeScript object exported here. This
 * satisfies all Phase 19 deliverables:
 *   - GET /openapi.json returns valid OpenAPI 3.1
 *   - GET /docs renders Redoc from it
 *   - Validation test passes (top-level keys + paths present)
 *   - Drift test checks every registered path prefix appears in this spec
 *
 * Future phases can incrementally migrate hot routes to zod-openapi for
 * schema-validated handlers; the spec endpoint can be replaced with the
 * generated output at that point with zero client-visible change.

/**
 * The complete OpenAPI 3.1 document.
 *
 * NOTE: The `as unknown as OpenAPIDocument` cast is required because the
 * deeply-nested `as const` objects from path files produce readonly literal
 * types that are assignable to the spec at runtime but not to a structural
 * OpenAPI type without widening. This is acceptable — the spec is correct;
 * the type assertion is only for downstream consumers that want a typed handle.
