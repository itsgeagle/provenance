/**
 * terminal_active_during_external_change heuristic (Phase 17).
 *
 * PRD §7.4 environment: "A terminal was open at the time an external file
 * change occurred, suggesting the external change may have been script-driven."
 *
 * Logic:
 *   For each `fs.external_change` event, check whether any terminal was open
 *   at that time within the same session. A terminal is considered "open" if
 *   the session has any `terminal.open` event with `t ≤ externalChange.t` and
 *   no corresponding close (terminal.close is not in the event set — the
 *   recorder does not emit terminal.close events in v1). We therefore treat
 *   a terminal as open from its `terminal.open` event until the session ends.
 *
 * This is a weak signal: an open terminal is common and doesn't prove the
 * external change was script-driven. However, combined with `mass_external_
 * replacement` or `external_edits` flags, it strengthens the case.
 *
 * Severity: 'info'. Confidence: 0.6.
 *
 * One flag per `fs.external_change` event that co-occurs with an open terminal.
 * De-duplicated by the change event's seq.
 *
 * Known limitation — signal-to-noise:
 *   Once any `terminal.open` event appears in a session, every subsequent
 *   `fs.external_change` event will fire this heuristic for the remainder of
 *   the session (since terminal.close is never emitted; terminals remain "open"
 *   until session end). In sessions with many external changes (e.g., auto-save,
 *   formatter runs, git operations), this results in repeated 'info' flags that
 *   dilute the flag list and weaken the signal. Example: a 4-hour session with
 *   one terminal open and 30 external changes yields 30 'info' flags, none of
 *   which directly indicate dishonesty.
 *
 *   Mitigations for future polish:
 *   - Gate on co-occurrence with `external_edits` or `mass_external_replacement`
 *     flags (strengthens the case that the terminal contributed to the change).
 *   - Aggregate to a single per-session flag listing all affected external-change
 *     events, rather than one per event.
 *   - Consider filtering out external changes with explanations that suggest
 *     automated origin (e.g., "git", "formatter").
