/**
 * gap_in_heartbeats heuristic (Phase 17; suspend-aware revision 2026-07).
 *
 * PRD §7.4 integrity: "Consecutive heartbeats more than 5 minutes apart with
 * no session end/start pair between them — suggests the recorder may have been
 * paused or the log file altered."
 *
 * Logic:
 *   For each session, iterate consecutive pairs of `session.heartbeat` events
 *   (ordered by seq). Compute the wall-time gap between each pair. A gap is
 *   flagged only when ALL of the following hold:
 *     1. The gap exceeds `gapThresholdMs` (default: 5 minutes).
 *     2. No `session.end` sits between the two heartbeats (see below).
 *     3. At least one event of ANY kind exists in the same session with `seq`
 *        strictly between the two heartbeats' `seq`.
 *
 * Why condition 3: when a laptop sleeps, the OS suspends the extension host.
 * No timer fires, so the 30s heartbeat (and other periodic writers, e.g. the
 * 5-min `ext.snapshot`) simply stop — but the extension is never deactivated,
 * so no `session.end` is written either. On wake, everything resumes as if
 * nothing happened. That gap is indistinguishable from misconduct by wall-time
 * alone, but it has one reliable signature: nothing was recorded during it,
 * because nothing was running. If the recorder process had merely been
 * stalled (log writes suppressed while other work continued), *other* event
 * kinds recorded by other handlers would still land between the two
 * heartbeats. So an empty gap (zero intervening events, of any kind) is
 * machine suspend, not a paused/tampered recorder, and is not flagged. A gap
 * containing at least one other event demonstrates the process was executing
 * and yet failed to heartbeat — that is still flagged.
 *
 * "No session.end between them" is determined by checking whether any
 * `session.end` event exists in the same session with `seq` between the two
 * heartbeats. Because heartbeat events are single-session, cross-session
 * boundaries cannot occur between two heartbeats of the same session.
 *
 * Wall-time comparison: heartbeat `wall` field (ISO 8601 string). We use
 * Date.parse() for the diff — this is safe because we are not injecting into
 * any log (this is read-only analysis). Non-parseable wall strings produce NaN,
 * which comparison guards handle by skipping.
 *
 * Severity: 'medium'. Confidence: 0.75.
 * (Gaps can be legitimate even when flagged — the student may have worked
 * with the recorder stalled for an innocuous reason. But an empty gap window
 * is affirmatively suspend, not a candidate for staff review at all.)
 *
 * One flag per gap (not per session). Multiple gaps in one session → multiple
 * flags, each pointing to the two bounding heartbeat events.

/**
 * How far inside a gap an event's wall clock must sit before it counts as

 * On wake, every timer that came due while the machine was suspended fires in
 * one batch, so unrelated periodic events land within a millisecond or two of
 * the heartbeat bounding the gap. Those are wake artifacts, not activity.
 * 1s is far wider than the observed batch spread (median 1ms) and far narrower
 * than any real recording cadence, so it separates the two cleanly.
