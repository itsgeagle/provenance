/**
 * Shared iterator for paste-content heuristics (large_paste, paste_is_solution,
 * paste_matches_known_source).
 *
 * Recorder v1.2 broadened the paste classifier (PRD §4.3) so that tool-applied
 * bulk edits — multi-delta WorkspaceEdits, large replacement edits — get
 * marked as `source: "paste_likely"` on `doc.change` events instead of being
 * routed through the `paste` event kind. That routing preserves reconstruction
 * fidelity (applyDocChange can reproduce multi-delta and non-empty-range edits
 * faithfully; applyPaste cannot), but it means the analyzer's existing
 * paste-content heuristics, which only iterate `kind === 'paste'`, miss those
 * events entirely.
 *
 * This module provides a single iterator that yields one `CandidatePaste` per
 * inserted blob, regardless of whether the recorder stored it as a `paste`
 * event or as a paste-shaped `doc.change`. The three paste-content heuristics
 * iterate this instead of `index.byKind.get('paste')` so they catch both
 * shapes consistently.
