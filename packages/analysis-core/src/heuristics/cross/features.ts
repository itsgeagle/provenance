/**
 * Cross-submission feature extraction (memory-bounded input for cross-heuristics).
 *
 * The cross-heuristics (paste_shared_across_students, editing_pattern_clone) only
 * need a tiny slice of each submission, NOT the full Bundle + EventIndex:
 *
 *   - paste_shared: each paste event's `${sessionId}:${seq}` key + length/sha256/content.
 *   - editing_pattern_clone: the SET of 3-grams of the event-kind stream (a bounded
 *     "fingerprint" — independent of event count) + the first few seq keys as
 *     representative references.
 *
 * Holding full bundles for an entire semester at once OOMs the server (a 50k-event
 * bundle × hundreds of submissions = multiple GB). `CrossSubmissionFeatures` is the
 * compact per-submission representation the heuristics consume instead. The browser
 * builds it from an in-memory Bundle/EventIndex via `extractCrossFeatures`; the
 * server builds the same shape by streaming rows from the DB (one submission at a
 * time, discarding the heavy event stream after fingerprinting).
