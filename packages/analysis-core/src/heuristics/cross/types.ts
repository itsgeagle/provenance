/**
 * CrossFlag — a heuristic finding that spans multiple bundles.
 *
 * Phase 18 introduces cross-bundle heuristics (paste_shared_across_students,
 * editing_pattern_clone). Unlike a per-bundle Flag (which references events in
 * one bundle), a CrossFlag names the involved bundles and, per bundle, the
 * supporting event seq keys.
 *
 * Shape choices (A59):
 *   - Separate type from Flag to keep Flag clean (no optional bundle fields
 *     that are always null for per-bundle heuristics).
 *   - `eventsPerBundle` is a plain object (Record<bundleId, seqKey[]>) rather
 *     than a Map so it round-trips through JSON and React state without issues.
 *   - Severity + confidence reuse the same Severity union from Flag so UI
 *     rendering components need no changes.

 *
 * `bundleIds` — the Bundle.id values involved. Always length >= 2.
 *
 * `eventsPerBundle` — for each bundleId, an array of `${sessionId}:${seq}`
