/**
 * LandingView — public front door at `/` (no auth required).
 *
 * A short explainer of what Provenance is, shown before the sign-in page.
 * The CTA is auth-aware: signed-out visitors get "Sign in with Google";
 * signed-in staff get "Open dashboard →". We never block the page render on
 * the auth check — content shows immediately and the CTA resolves when
 * useMe() settles (undefined while loading or when unauthenticated → sign-in).
 *
 * WCAG 2.1 AA: single h1, h2 section headings, a <main> landmark, contrast-safe
 * gray text (700/600/900), visible focus rings, decorative mark aria-hidden
 * (the "Provenance" wordmark carries the accessible name).

            Provenance is a VS Code extension for lower-division CS courses. While a student works,
            it keeps a running, tamper-evident record of how their code came together, and that
            record is turned in with the assignment. When something about a submission raises a
            question, staff can look at the history behind it instead of guessing.

            Provenance captures the whole timeline of an assignment, not just the file that gets
            submitted. Staff can replay how the work took shape, and the tool points out moments
            worth a second look on its own — for instance, a finished function that appears in one
            large paste rather than being typed out.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Protects honest students</h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700">
            This is not only about catching people. An honest work history is also the best defense
            a student has: if a submission gets questioned, the same record can show that they wrote
            it themselves.

              The extension works entirely offline. It never sends anything anywhere while a student
              is working.

            <li>
              How it works is public. The protocol and the extension&rsquo;s source are open, so
              students can read exactly what it does.

              We keep the process log, not the code. Student source files are only used to check the
              log at submission time, and are not stored afterward.
