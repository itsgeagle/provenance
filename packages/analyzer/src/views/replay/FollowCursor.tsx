/**
 * FollowCursor — keeps the point of interest in view as the replay plays.
 *
 * Headless component (returns null), mirroring CursorMarker and
 * GutterDecorations: it drives a side effect on the Monaco editor and renders
 * nothing.
 *
 * Behaviour: whenever the position of interest changes, scroll it back into view
 * and centre it — but ONLY if it has left the viewport. Typing inside the
 * visible window causes no scrolling at all, so there is no per-keystroke
 * jitter.
 *
 * The point of interest is normally the student's caret. While an
 * `fs.external_change` holds the viewport, it is that event's position instead
 * (see external-change-focus.ts): nothing moves the caret to an external write,
 * so without this the reviewer plays straight past it. Because the reveal is
 * driven by whichever target is active — not by a timer — the viewport returns
 * to the caret on the student's next edit or cursor move, and the return is
 * itself just another target change.
 *
 * Why no "follow on/off" toggle: the reveal fires only when the caret position
 * changes, which only happens when the playhead moves (play, step, scrub,
 * sidebar seek, jump-to-next-paste, file switch). A reviewer who scrolls away
 * while paused is therefore never yanked back until they move the playhead
 * themselves.
 *
 * `content` is a dependency, not just a prop we ignore: on a file-tab switch
 * @monaco-editor/react calls model.setValue(), which resets the viewport to the
 * top. Re-revealing when the content changes undoes that reset even when the
 * caret coordinates happen to be unchanged.
