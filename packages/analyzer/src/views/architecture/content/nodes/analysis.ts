A paste joins a group on either an exact sha256 match against the group, or a line-overlap ratio of at least 0.9 against a group member that has inline content. One group covers both mechanisms on purpose: splitting exact and fuzzy into separate flag types fragments what is really one finding and forces the UI to de-duplicate it again. Every group spanning two or more bundles emits one high-severity flag; the match mechanism moves confidence (0.95 for a group joined only by hashes, 0.8 once any fuzzy match contributed) not severity.\n\nGrouping is a linear scan in which a paste joins the first group it matches, not a true transitive closure. Order therefore matters at the margins, though the input order is deterministic. The alternative is a full similarity graph over every paste in a semester, which is quadratic in the one place that already dominates the cost of a cross run.',

    body: 'Each submission is reduced to the set of 3-grams of its event-kind stream, and every pair is scored by Jaccard similarity; at or above 0.3 the pair emits a medium flag at confidence 0.7. A set rather than a multiset is the load-bearing choice: counting occurrences would let a submission with ten thousand doc.change events dominate every comparison, whereas the set of distinct 3-grams a session produces is bounded by the event-kind alphabet no matter how long the session ran.\n\nThe fingerprint holds no content, no file names and no timings, only the sequence of event kinds. It can therefore say that two students worked in a similar rhythm and can say nothing whatever about what either of them wrote, which is both its privacy property and the reason it caps at medium. Structurally similar workflows are ordinary; the signal is suggestive and never conclusive.',

    body: 'A cross flag names bundles rather than events inside one submission, which is why it is a separate type with its own storage: one row for the finding, one participant row per submission involved. A per-submission flag can hang off a submission id; a finding about a group cannot, and flattening it into per-submission copies would show a reviewer the same finding several times with no way to tell they were one thing.\n\nOn the server the whole semester’s set is deleted and re-inserted on every run, inside one transaction under an advisory lock. Merging is not available: a cross flag’s identity is not stable across runs (adding one submission changes the bundle ids in a group and therefore the flag id) and a fresh run can legitimately produce fewer flags than the last one, which a merge would leave behind as stale rows describing a group that no longer exists.',
