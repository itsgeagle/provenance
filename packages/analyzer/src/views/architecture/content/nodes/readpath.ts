At fifty thousand rows the per-page flag aggregation and the top-flags window function were the p95; folding their results onto the submission row at write time turned the list back into a single indexed query with keyset pagination, so deep pages stay as cheap as the first.',

The full event index is the priciest fetch in the app, so Overview loads it lazily and only when a panel that needs supporting-event labels is actually opened; until then it shows bare global indices. This is why the diagram draws it toward the cheap path even though one bundle parse is unavoidable.',
