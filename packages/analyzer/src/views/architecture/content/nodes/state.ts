In every other folder the extension host never wakes it, so dormant is less a running state than the absence of one.\n\nDormant is also where a workspace lands when a manifest is present but does not verify. The recorder keeps exactly one foothold there: a stub registration for the Prepare Submission Bundle command that does nothing but explain itself when invoked. Without it, a student who runs the command in the wrong folder gets VS Code’s opaque “command not found”. The stub writes no files and records nothing, so the “does nothing” guarantee still holds.',

A manifest that is missing, malformed, or badly signed produces one console line and nothing else: no dialog, no status bar, no log file, no .provenance/ directory. An error dialog would be a probe: it would tell whoever was editing the manifest exactly when they had the format right and only the signature wrong, and it would fire on every unrelated folder that happened to contain a file with that name. Silence gives the same protection and leaks nothing.',

Activation scans the open workspace folders for manifests at any depth and starts one independent session per directory whose manifest verifies, each with its own .provenance/ directory, its own log file, and its own freshly generated ed25519 keypair. Every state in this diagram therefore applies per session: one assignment can be degraded or dangling while another beside it keeps recording normally.\n\nThe session private key never sits on disk in the clear. It is encrypted under the course manifest’s signature and written to the .slog.meta sidecar, and every hundredth entry is signed with it as a checkpoint. Checkpoints are what make an unfinished log still provable: if the process dies mid-session, everything up to the last checkpoint carries a signature over its chain hash.',

That looks lossy and is deliberate: a failed write may have partially succeeded, so re-appending the same buffer risks duplicating entries in the middle of the hash chain. A short, honest log is usable evidence; a log with a duplicated run of entries fails chain validation and is worth nothing.\n\nFrom that point the session retains only six critical event kinds (session start and end, external changes, chain breaks, and the two recorder events) in a 256-entry in-memory ring, and drops everything else. The transition is one-way for the life of the session: nothing clears the degraded flag, which is why the notification asks the student to free space and restart the editor rather than promising to resume on its own.',

    body: 'When a laptop sleeps, the OS parks the extension host: no timer fires, so the 30-second heartbeat stops, but the extension is never deactivated, so no session end is written either. By wall clock alone that hole is indistinguishable from a recorder someone paused or a log someone trimmed, which is exactly why it has to be a modelled state rather than an unexplained gap.\n\nTwo mechanisms separate it from tampering. The recorder compares each heartbeat tick’s wall clock against the previous tick’s and emits a session.resumed marker when the gap reaches twice the interval; this must be wall clock, because macOS keeps its monotonic clock advancing through sleep while Linux does not, so a monotonic comparison would disagree across platforms. The analyzer then applies the decisive test: a gap with nothing recorded inside it means nothing was executing, so it is sleep. A gap with real activity inside it means the process was running and still failed to heartbeat, and that is flagged.',

A log with no session end is therefore the ordinary crash signature rather than a suspicious one, and both the recorder and the analyzer read it that way.\n\nWhat matters is where such a session is treated as ending. Analysis bounds it at the wall clock of its last recorded event, never at infinity. Leaving it open-ended meant a single crash on day one overlapped every session that started afterwards, for the rest of the assignment: a permanent false positive from one power cut. The last recorded event is the last moment the session demonstrably existed; extending the range beyond it invents evidence.',

A prior log that ends in session.end needs nothing further: it closed cleanly, and linking to it would only clutter the session graph. Only a dangling log causes the new session’s session.start to carry prev_session_id, so that field means “the session before this one died”, not merely “the session before this one”.\n\nIf the prior chain fails to validate, the file is renamed with a .corrupt- suffix and a recorder.recovered_from_corruption event in the new session records where it went. Sealing then excludes .corrupt- files from the bundle: staff learn that corruption happened and when, without the unverifiable bytes travelling with the submission.',

A student whose recording was interrupted must still be able to submit, and the integrity evidence is far more useful to staff inside a bundle than withheld from one.\n\nThe state is a snapshot, not a terminus. The session keeps recording after the zip is written, and sealing again simply produces another bundle.
