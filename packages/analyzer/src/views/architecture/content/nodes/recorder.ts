Everything expensive is therefore pushed elsewhere — the entry is hashed and enqueued synchronously, and the actual write happens on a buffered flush.\n\nTwo filters run before anything else. Changes carrying no content deltas — dirty-flag toggles, encoding and line-ending changes — are dropped early, because they are noise to the analyzer, though their timestamp is still recorded to keep the file watcher’s tolerance window honest. And a change on a still-clean buffer is checked against what is actually on disk before being treated as an edit at all: the editor delivers the content change before it flips the dirty flag, so a genuine reload from disk and a student’s first keystroke after a save arrive with identical signatures. Only the disk comparison separates them — if the buffer now matches disk it was a reload, if it diverged it was a real edit.',

IntelliJ lets the plugin wrap the EditorPaste action, and Neovim lets it wrap vim.paste, so both see the paste in the same call stack as the edit it causes. VS Code does not: registering a handler for a built-in command id such as editor.action.clipboardPasteAction throws in the extension host, and there is no supported way around it.\n\nThe VS Code port therefore registers a separate command of its own that calls the built-in paste underneath, and course staff may bind it to Cmd+V through a workspace keybinding. Where that binding is not installed this signal simply contributes nothing — and the recorder does not pretend otherwise. The intercept count still feeds the reconciler, so an absent signal 2 shows up as a recorded discrepancy rather than as silently misclassified pastes.',

Without a hook inside the built-in paste command there is no moment at which reading the clipboard would be attributable to a specific edit, and a clipboard read at any other time is just surveillance of whatever the student last copied. So the VS Code recorder never reads the clipboard at all, and its third signal is the count reconciliation instead.

Its guard is a tolerance window: a change within 250 ms of that file’s last document change or last save is assumed to be the editor’s own write and skipped. Anchoring on the save as well as the change is load-bearing, because the editor’s autosave delay defaults to a full second, so a window anchored only on the last keystroke would never cover the editor saving the file it just autosaved.',

The heuristic that looks for the absence of intermediate errors — a file that goes from empty to finished with no failing command in between — cannot distinguish "never ran anything that failed" from "we could not see the commands", so when shell integration is off it emits an info-severity skip with the reason attached instead of a finding. A separate heuristic notes the disabled integration itself, since turning it off is one of the cheaper ways to make a session look cleaner than it was.',

The value is less in the event than in its side effect: each emission marks the explanation tagger, so an external file change arriving in the seconds after a checkout carries an explanation instead of becoming an unexplained-external-edit flag.

Selection changes are recorded as they come, and are among the noisiest kinds in a log.\n\nExtension observation rides here too, and it is two mechanisms rather than one. A snapshot of every installed extension with its version is taken at session start and every five minutes after; separately, a poller diffs the active set once a second and emits an activation event for anything newly active. The pair is what makes "an assistant appeared partway through" detectable at all — the heuristic fires on an activation whose extension was absent from the session-start snapshot, which a five-minute snapshot cadence alone could not pin down. "Enabled" in the snapshot is an approximation: the public API exposes whether an extension has activated, not whether it is enabled, and the recorder records the honest field rather than inventing the one it wants.',

Collapsing to any one of them buys simplicity by giving up the case the others cover.\n\nIn VS Code the join happens in two places, not one. Signals 1 and 2 are combined per event in the document handler, and signal 3 is a separate periodic pass: every five seconds it compares how many pastes were intercepted against how many bulk insertions were classified, and a divergence beyond a tolerance of one emits a paste.anomaly.

If the disk holds a state this buffer genuinely passed through, the write was ours, observed late: emit nothing, and specifically do not reset, because the live buffer is ahead and authoritative. Content the buffer never held still falls through and is reported, so a real external write is unaffected.
