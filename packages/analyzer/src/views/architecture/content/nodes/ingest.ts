A Content-Length above the cap is refused before a byte is read.\n\nThe point at which the browser switches to the chunked path is not really a judgement about size: it is pinned to exactly one chunk, 16 MiB. The deployment sits behind an nginx whose client_max_body_size is around 20 MiB, so any single request carrying more than one part is rejected before it reaches the app. Splitting at one chunk guarantees that neither a part PUT nor a single-shot POST can ever exceed that limit. Part state lives in the S3/MinIO multipart upload rather than in a server-side table, so a resume works across API processes and across restarts.',

Stripping rewrites the archive, so the stored blob’s own hash differs by design.

Merging would be wrong on both counts — a later run can legitimately produce fewer flags, because a submission was superseded or a student left, and a flag whose membership grows with the cohort has no stable identity to merge on in the first place.\n\nParticipants are the join back to submissions. Each carries its own supporting event references as chronological indices, translated from the (session, seq) keys the heuristics emit through a map built during feature extraction, so the analyzer can jump straight to the events on both sides of a match rather than to the flag as a whole. The bundle ids the cross heuristics reason with are synthetic and exist only for the duration of a run.',

It comes from four separate things: a status guard that skips any ingest file already resolved, upserts for the statistics and validation rows, a version allocation serialized by a row lock, and — for flags, which have no natural unique key and are inserted plainly — the fact that their transaction has not committed when a retry happens. Callers outside that transaction have to delete a submission’s flags first, and the recompute path does exactly that.\n\nWhat a retry guarantees, then, is that the same bundle yields the same rows, not that every stage is individually replayable: past the point where the submission exists, the file is not retried at all. Finalization is idempotent in the plainer sense — it refuses to recompute a job already in a terminal state, and a cancelled job keeps its status while its summary is refreshed so the counts from a cooperative cancel are still visible.',
