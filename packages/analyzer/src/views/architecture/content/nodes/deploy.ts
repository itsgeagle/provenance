A GET that resolves to a real asset is served as-is; anything else that is not under /api, /healthz or /metrics falls back to index.html so the SPA router can take the URL.\n\nEverything the reviewer sees past login is a request to this single origin, which is why the access story reduces to one check at the API rather than to network placement: the SPA is public bytes, and the data behind it is gated by the session the OAuth callback established.',

A token scoped to one semester can push submissions and nothing else, and if the gateway double-sends, content-hash dedup on the server absorbs it. The apphost therefore carries no gateway process, no gateway state, and no gateway failure mode.',

The public certificate, its renewal, and the proxy config all live on the IT side of the boundary.\n\nThat split is the largest external dependency of this deploy, which is why it is the first item on the coordination checklist: nginx’s config for the hostname must point at exactly the socket path the app creates, and the nginx worker — a different Unix user — must be able to connect to it. The runbook verifies this concretely on first deploy rather than trusting it, with an ls of the socket and a curl of /healthz through the public URL.',

It unlinks any stale socket a prior process left behind so listen() cannot fail with EADDRINUSE, and it chmods the socket world-writable, because nginx connects as a different user than the container-root that created it. SOCKET_PATH being set is also the switch that selects a socket over a port at all — unset, the server falls back to a TCP port for local dev and tests.',

It registers no pg-boss handlers; running jobs is the worker’s half.\n\nThe api process serves reads and the on-demand reconstruction cache rather than the ingest firehose, so a single replica is enough.

Analysis is CPU-bound on a single Node thread, so INGEST_CONCURRENCY only overlaps the I/O around it; real parallelism comes from --scale worker=N in the systemd unit, bounded by the box’s memory fair share.

Rootless Docker keeps its volumes, this container’s pgdata among them, under the NFS home directory, and Postgres on NFS is a known footgun for locking and fsync guarantees. Relocating the volume to local disk is an open item with IT; until it is resolved, the nightly pg_dump is the actual recovery guarantee, which is why the restore drill is treated as load-bearing rather than optional.

Because the pgdata volume lives on NFS — the footgun noted on the Postgres node — the dump is this deployment’s real recovery guarantee, not a convenience, and the runbook’s restore drill exercises it against these files. After each dump it pings the healthchecks.io dead-man’s switch (and a /fail variant on error), which is the only thing that makes a silently-broken backup visible before it is needed.',

The mount underneath it is the constrained resource: a 1 TB quota with no headroom, which is the whole reason ingest strips student source before storing and the reason there is no events table — both were storage this backend could not afford to keep.',

A submission’s cohort placement, its score, and its flags stay queryable for audit years later; what goes is the ability to re-open the underlying evidence once the retention window has passed. Deleting rows would make the system unable to answer questions about a case still open long after the semester closed — the exact situation the product exists to serve.
