A .vsix, a JetBrains plugin zip and a Neovim plugin’s lua/ tree therefore all produce hashes of the same kind and live in the same list.

The signature itself is also copied into the payload, which is what lets validation check 2 assert that every session in a bundle was started against the same assignment manifest.

The first groups pastes of at least a hundred characters across bundles by content identity, joining a group on either an exact sha256 match or a high line-overlap ratio — one group covering both mechanisms, because splitting exact and fuzzy into separate flag types fragments what is really one finding. The second compares editing rhythm: Jaccard similarity over the set of 3-grams of each bundle’s event-kind stream, which is insensitive to content and therefore says nothing about what was written, only about how.\n\nThey run on a different schedule from everything else in this lane. Per-submission analysis belongs to one file’s job; a cross-submission comparison is meaningful only across a cohort, so ingest finalization enqueues a separate semester-scoped sweep, collapsed by singleton key so a batch of a hundred files produces one recomputation rather than a hundred.',

Each flag stores the weight that was in force when it was computed, so a score can always be explained by the configuration that produced it.\n\nInfo-severity flags are worth understanding, because they look like noise and are not. The default severity weights are 0 for info, 1 for low, 3 for medium and 8 for high — so an info flag contributes exactly nothing to the score and cannot pull a submission up the queue. That is how the system records a finding it has decided not to act on: a large paste that turns out to be the student relocating their own previously-typed code stays in the record, with its size and its origin, downgraded to info rather than deleted. Evidence is never destroyed to reduce noise; it is de-weighted, so that a reviewer looking at a specific submission still sees it.',

When a principal is protected, student identity never leaves the server — names and student ids are replaced with stable placeholders derived from a per-roster index, falling back to a slice of the random row UUID if that index is somehow absent, so masking can never degrade into real identifiers. This is what lets a course run the review with the reviewer blind to who they are looking at until a decision to look closer has already been made.',

No analysis anywhere reasons about the meaning of the student’s code — every heuristic reads process evidence, and the deliberate absence of any classifier over source is what keeps the output arguable.

The sixth, Export, is a v3.1 stub — see the export node.\n\nSource is the tab with the subtlety, because the submitted bytes are not stored. The file list and its per-file verdicts come from the signed manifest compared against the recorded on-disk hashes, and the content shown is reconstructed from the event stream — so for a file that matches, what you read is the submitted source, and for a file that does not, what you read is the recorded final state, which by definition differs from what was handed in.

The list is wider than the eighteen per-submission heuristics because it also covers the two cross-submission findings and the integrity findings derived from the validation checks. Weight multiplies the severity weight and the confidence to give a flag’s score contribution, so tuning changes what rises to the top of the queue without changing what was detected.\n\nNothing commits blind. Every adjustment debounces into a dry run that returns the score histogram before and after, the number of submissions whose tier would change, and the largest movers, so a course can see the effect of a change on the actual cohort before applying it. Committing writes a new config version and enqueues a recompute; flags keep the version and the weight they were computed under, so an old score stays explainable after the configuration has moved on.',
