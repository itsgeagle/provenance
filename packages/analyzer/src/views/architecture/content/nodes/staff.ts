The system’s entire claim is about order: it puts the submissions whose process evidence is unusual at the top so a limited number of review hours land where the evidence is.

Each row names the actor twice where that applies — the user id and, separately, the token id — so an action taken by a script is attributable both to the credential and to the person who created it, alongside the address, the user agent and a jsonb detail blob the route fills in with what actually changed.\n\nThe insert is fire-and-forget, and warns rather than throwing if it fails. That is a deliberate trade of completeness for availability: an audit failure must not turn a successful roster commit into an error the admin sees. Coverage is likewise partial by design — writes and the privileged reads are logged, ordinary cohort and submission reads are not, and the one read that is logged is the bundle download, because that is the moment the signed evidence leaves the system. Nothing in the application ever deletes from this table.',
