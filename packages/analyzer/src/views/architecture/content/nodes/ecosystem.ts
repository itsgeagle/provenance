An ESLint no-restricted-imports rule on packages/log-core/**/*.ts rejects vscode, node:fs, node:path, node:worker_threads, node:crypto and their bare aliases, so the package cannot reach for a Node buffer or a VS Code type even by accident.

The other two recorders sit behind a conformance gate because they carry a second copy of the format; this one carries none — it depends on log-core directly, so a format change reaches it for free and reaches the siblings only after their vectors are regenerated.

Because the manifest is ed25519-signed over its JCS-canonical bytes, a port that orders keys differently, formats a number differently, or drops a millisecond from a wall-clock string produces a manifest that will not verify against the course key — the recorder would run and the analyzer would reject every bundle it sealed.
